# MRF
Things for the mrfloris.com personal blog site.

## What is this about?

This repository is mainly for internal use. You don't have to browse this.

Thank you for checking out this repository though, I know some people like to know what I am up to.

## Can I contribute?

Not really, but.. sure? Contribute through offering blog topic suggestions, point out improvements on grammar, phrasing, false information, typing errors, etc. Or post if there's a missing image, page not working, or things like that. 

## Support?

There's no support really. You can explore this repository, or browse mrfloris.com, but there's no real support to give.

## Why a blog?

I've always had one, I've always changed the code behind it and the engine on a yearly basis. But with all these changes in life I just don't get around to it. In 2019/2020 it's a default WordPress blog front-end and back-end, and I am not happy about that. I want to go back to writing. Who knows what I will do in 2021/2022.
