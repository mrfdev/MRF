## Why a blog?

Maintaining a personal blog has been a longstanding practice for me. Over the years, I've made periodic changes to the underlying code and engine, though recently, due to life's demands, I haven't been able to do so. Presently, the blog utilizes the default WordPress front-end and back-end, which doesn't entirely satisfy me. My ultimate goal is to return to writing more frequently, and who knows what changes I might introduce in 2021/2022.
